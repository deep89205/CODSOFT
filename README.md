THESE ARE CPP PROJECTS I DID DURING MY CODESOFT INTERNSHIP
Task 1: Number Guessing Game
Create an interactive number guessing game program. The program generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it. It provides real-time feedback on whether the guessed number is too high or too low. The user keeps guessing until they correctly identify the generated number.

Task 2: Simple Calculator
Develop a basic calculator program that handles essential arithmetic operations - addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user inputs two numbers and selects an operation to perform. The program then calculates and displays the result of the chosen operation.

Task 3: Word Count Program
Design a program to analyze the word count in a specified text file. The program prompts the user to provide the file name and then calculates and displays the total number of words present in the text file
